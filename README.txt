*RainMod for Minecraft*
*Overview*
RainMod is a transformative Minecraft mod that introduces realistic rain and water behaviors into the vanilla game, enhancing the immersive experience of gameplay. With RainMod, rain in Minecraft becomes not just a visual effect but a dynamic environmental factor that interacts with the world around the player.

Features

Realistic Rain Generation

Dynamic Water Blocks: Water blocks are dynamically generated with a specific probability when it rains, adding to the realism of the game.

Randomized Placement: These water blocks appear at random positions within the chunks surrounding the player, ensuring a natural and unpredictable rain impact.

Persistent Generation: Water block generation continues throughout the duration of the rain, simulating accumulation and spreading of water.

Water Evaporation

Timed Evaporation: Once the rain stops, water blocks begin to evaporate after a pre-defined duration, mimicking natural water dissipation.

Configurable Probability: The evaporation process is random but configurable, with a default chance of 50%, allowing for a customizable environment.

Biome Integration

Biome-Specific Rain: Water blocks are generated only in biomes where rain is a natural phenomenon, enhancing the game's environmental fidelity.

Desert and Cold Biomes: In biomes where rain does not occur, such as deserts and cold regions, water blocks will not appear, maintaining ecological accuracy.

Configuration Commands

Customization: Players can customize the mod settings through specific commands, tailoring the rain and water behavior to their preferences.

/rainmod interval [ticks]: Sets the interval between water block generation (default: 10 ticks).

/rainmod chance [percentage]: Sets the probability of water block generation (default: 50%).

/rainmod evapchance [percentage]: Sets the probability of water block evaporation (default: 50%).

/rainmod evaptime [ticks]: Sets the duration between the end of rain and the start of water block evaporation (default: 600 ticks).

Performance-Conscious Design

Chunk-Based Management: By limiting water block management to a per-chunk basis, the mod minimizes memory usage and processing demands.

Fixed Tick Intervals: Generation and evaporation processes are executed at fixed intervals, ensuring minimal performance impact.
